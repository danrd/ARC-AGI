"""Putting prompt blocks into a module's prompt without the config having to name them.

The orchestration pieces add to what the model is shown - the tools it may ask for, the
memory of its earlier attempts - and each does it through a block that is empty unless
there is something to say. A config that has never heard of them is left as it was; the
piece that needs them installs them in the module's builder, before `output_format`.
